This readme file outlines the entire process, with explanations and snippets for each part of the code provided in `main.py`, `transform.py`, and `trainer3.py`. Here's a detailed explanation and example code for each step:

---

### `main.py`


#### Overview:
This script orchestrates the flow from XML and action files to CSV processing, model training, and prediction. The main steps are:
1. Processing XML and action files into structured CSV data.
2. Cleaning and transforming data using `process_csv`.
3. Using a pre-trained model to generate predictions.
4. Comparing predictions against actual results for accuracy.

#### Step-by-Step Code:

1. **Input Directory Setup**: Directories for XML, actions, and output files are defined, and output folders are created. These directories need to be updated to the specific, correct directories.

```python
xml_dir = '/home/user/VisionRD_COMP/xml'
actions_dir = '/home/user/VisionRD_COMP/actions'
output_dir = '/home/user/VisionRD_COMP/csv_folder_result'
output_dir_inter = '/home/user/VisionRD_COMP/csv_folder_result_inter'
output_txt_folder = '/home/user/VisionRD_COMP/ResultTxtOutput'
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
```

2. **Accuracy Calculation**:
   The `calculate_accuracy` function compares two files line-by-line to calculate accuracy.

```python
def calculate_accuracy(actual_file, sample_file):
    with open(actual_file, 'r') as f1, open(sample_file, 'r') as f2:
        actual_lines = f1.readlines()
        sample_lines = f2.readlines()

    total_lines = min(len(actual_lines), len(sample_lines))
    matches = sum(1 for i in range(total_lines) if actual_lines[i].strip() == sample_lines[i].strip())
    accuracy = (matches / total_lines) * 100 if total_lines > 0 else 0
    return accuracy, matches, total_lines
```

3. **Processing Files**: This step parses XML files, processes them with corresponding action files, and stores intermediate results in CSV files.

```python
for xml_filename in os.listdir(xml_dir):
    if xml_filename.endswith('.xml'):
        base_name = os.path.splitext(xml_filename)[0]
        xml_path = os.path.join(xml_dir, xml_filename)
        actions_path = os.path.join(actions_dir, f"{base_name}.txt")
        intermediate_csv_path = os.path.join(output_dir_inter, f"{base_name}_intermediate.csv")
        final_csv_path = os.path.join(output_dir, f"{base_name}.csv")

        if os.path.exists(actions_path):
            print(f"Processing: {xml_filename} with {base_name}.txt")
            process_files(xml_path, actions_path, intermediate_csv_path)
            tcsv.process_csv(intermediate_csv_path, final_csv_path)
            trans_model.process_predictions(final_csv_path, output_txt_folder)
```

4. **Directory Processing**: It processes matching pairs of files in the directories and calculates the accuracy between actual and predicted results.

```python
process_directories(actions_dir, output_txt_folder)
```

### `transform.py`

#### Overview:
This script is used to transform and normalize the data before training. It processes the CSV by calculating the minimum value for hand features and adjusting the data accordingly.

#### Code Explanation:

1. **Feature Lists**:
   Lists are created to store features for the left and right hand coordinates in both `x` and `y` axes.

```python
x_axis_left_features = [
    'left_xtl', 'left_xbr', 'left_thumb_x_1', 'left_thumb_x_2', # etc.
]
```

2. **`process_csv` Function**:
   This function reads a CSV file, processes each row to calculate the minimum for hand features, and adjusts the data accordingly.

```python
def process_csv(input_file, output_file):
    df = pd.read_csv(input_file)
    feature_groups = {
        "x_left": x_axis_left_features,
        "x_right": x_axis_right_features,
        "y_left": y_axis_left_features,
        "y_right": y_axis_right_features
    }

    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        min_values = {}
        for group_name, features in feature_groups.items():
            values = [pd.to_numeric(row[feature], errors='coerce') for feature in features]
            min_value = min([value for value in values if pd.notna(value)], default=0)
            min_values[f"{group_name}_min"] = min_value

            for feature in features:
                original_value = pd.to_numeric(row[feature], errors='coerce')
                if pd.notna(original_value):
                    df.at[index, feature] = original_value - min_value

    df.to_csv(output_file, index=False)
    print(f"Processed file saved to {output_file}")
```

### `trainer3.py`

#### Overview:
This script trains a Random Forest model, processes predictions, and evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

#### Code Explanation:

1. **Loading and Cleaning Data**:
   It reads the CSV file, cleans the data by replacing invalid values with `NaN`, and converts columns to numeric.

```python
def clean_data(df, columns_to_clean):
    df.replace('Nan', np.nan, inplace=True)
    for col in columns_to_clean:
        df[col] = pd.to_numeric(df[col], errors='coerce')
    return df
```

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   Additional features like `x_diff`, `y_diff`, and `bbox_area` are derived from the existing columns to help with training.

```python
test_df['x_diff'] = test_df['left_xtl'] - test_df['right_xtl']
test_df['y_diff'] = test_df['left_ytl'] - test_df['right_ytl']
test_df['bbox_area'] = (test_df['left_xbr'] - test_df['left_xtl']) * (test_df['left_ybr'] - test_df['left_ytl'])
```

3. **Model Training**:
   The pipeline is set up with scaling, imputation, and a Random Forest classifier. This model is used to make predictions, and the results are evaluated using accuracy metrics.

```python
# Example pipeline setup
model = make_pipeline(
    StandardScaler(),
    SimpleImputer(strategy='mean'),
    RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
)

# Training process (assuming X_train and y_train are defined)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction and evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
```

4. **Saving Predictions**:
   After making predictions, the results are saved to text files.

```python
def process_predictions(input_csv_path, output_folder_path):
    os.makedirs(output_folder_path, exist_ok=True)
    test_df = pd.read_csv(input_csv_path)
    # Prediction and saving process...
```
